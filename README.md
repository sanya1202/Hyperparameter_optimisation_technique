# Automated Hyperparameter Optimization using Bayesian Optimization

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to develop an efficient and automated Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) system leveraging AutoML techniques. This system aims to identify optimal hyperparameter configurations for machine learning models, tailored to specific datasets and tasks, through iterative experimentation and adaptive learning. By utilizing algorithms like Bayesian Optimization and Random Search, the system navigates complex hyperparameter spaces to maximize model performance metrics such as accuracy and precision. The HPO system addresses the challenge of manual hyperparameter tuning, empowering practitioners to achieve superior model performance with reduced effort and time investment.

## Technique Used
In this project, Bayesian Optimization was employed as the primary technique for hyperparameter tuning. Bayesian Optimization is a sequential model-based optimization method that uses probabilistic models to predict the performance of different hyperparameter configurations.

### Advantages of Bayesian Optimization
1. *Efficiency*: Requires fewer evaluations of the objective function compared to exhaustive grid search or random search, as it intelligently selects promising hyperparameter configurations.
2. *Global Optima*: Focuses on finding the global optimum rather than getting stuck in local optima, making it suitable for complex and multimodal hyperparameter spaces.
3. *Adaptive*: Dynamically adjusts the search based on previous evaluations, effectively balancing exploration (searching new areas) and exploitation (exploiting known good areas).
4. *Handles Noise*: Can handle noisy evaluations of the objective function by modeling uncertainty, making it robust in real-world scenarios where objective function evaluations may vary.
5. *Flexibility*: Can accommodate different types of hyperparameters (continuous, discrete, categorical) and handle constraints or dependencies between hyperparameters, making it versatile for various machine learning models.

## Code Explanation

### Data Processing
The code defines a function load_and_preprocess_data that streamlines data loading, preprocessing, and splitting, ensuring datasets are ready for model training and evaluation. It includes the following steps:

1. *Loading Data*: Reads a dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
2. *Handling Target Column*: Separates the dataset into features (X) and the target (y).
3. *Identifying Feature Types*: Identifies numeric and categorical features based on their data types.
4. *Defining Transformers*: Sets up preprocessing pipelines for numeric (imputes missing values and scales) and categorical (imputes and encodes) features.
5. *Applying Transformations*: Uses ColumnTransformer to apply the defined transformers to their respective feature types.
6. *Train-Test Split*: Splits the preprocessed data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

### Models and Hyperparameter Space Definition
The code defines a function define_model_and_hyperparameters that sets up a specified machine learning model and its corresponding hyperparameter search space. This function streamlines the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning tasks, including:

- Model Selection: Supports a variety of models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, neural network, support vector machine (SVM), and gradient boosting, for both classification and regression tasks.
- Model Initialization: Initializes the appropriate model from scikit-learn based on the provided model_type.
- Hyperparameter Definition: Defines a dictionary of hyperparameters and their respective ranges or values to explore during hyperparameter tuning for each model type.

### Bayesian Optimization Implementation
The code defines an objective_function used to optimize hyperparameters for various machine learning models. The optimization aims to maximize model accuracy by minimizing the negative cross-validation score. Here's how the code works:

1. *Imports*: Necessary imports for numerical operations, optimization routines, Gaussian process regression, and machine learning models.
2. *Objective Function*: Takes a dictionary params containing hyperparameters for a specific model.
3. *Model Selection*: Initializes a machine learning model based on the model_type and provided params.
4. *Hyperparameters*: Extracts hyperparameters from the params dictionary and uses them to initialize the model.
5. *Cross-Validation*: Performs k-fold cross-validation on the initialized model using the training data and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
6. *Score Calculation*: Computes the mean accuracy score from cross-validation and returns its negative value, as the optimization routine aims to minimize the objective function.

The code then performs Bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameters for a given machine learning model by maximizing model performance (minimizing the negative cross-validation accuracy score). Key components include:

1. *Encoding and Decoding Functions*: Converts hyperparameter values to and from numerical arrays for optimization algorithms.
2. *Sampling Hyperparameters*: Randomly samples hyperparameter values from the defined search space.
3. *Bayesian Optimization Function*: The main function bayesian_optimization that iteratively updates a Gaussian Process model with new samples, evaluates an acquisition function (Expected Improvement) to determine the next point to sample, and optimizes the objective function over multiple iterations.
4. *Result*: After the specified number of iterations, finds and returns the best set of hyperparameters and the corresponding objective value.

### Comparative Analysis
The report includes a comparative analysis of the performance of three hyperparameter optimization techniques: Random Search, HyperOpt, and Bayesian Optimization. The analysis compares the accuracy scores achieved by each technique on various datasets and machine learning models. The results are presented in the form of graphs and visualizations.

## Conclusion
This implementation of Bayesian optimization provides a structured and efficient method for hyperparameter tuning. By leveraging the Gaussian Process model and the expected improvement acquisition function, it intelligently navigates the hyperparameter space to find the optimal settings for the specified machine learning model, significantly improving model performance.
